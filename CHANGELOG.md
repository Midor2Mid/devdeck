# Changelog

## 0.1.3 — 2026-06-28

- **Browser network capture** — Comment Mode's "Send to AI" now includes captured
  network requests (summary + failed/4xx/5xx) alongside comments, console, and screenshot.
- **API smart-paste** — paste a cURL command into the URL bar and it auto-parses.
- **Activity feed** (⧗) — agent events (started / needs-attention / closed) across all
  projects; click to jump.
- **Canvas connectors** — link terminal cards with ⚯; lines follow pan/zoom; persisted.

## 0.1.2 — 2026-06-28

- **Command palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`): fuzzy-run any action — views, layouts, themes,
  new agent/SSH sessions, jump-to-session, settings. (Composer moved to `Ctrl+Shift+I`.)
- **Canvas zoom** (`Ctrl+scroll`, 40–200%; double-click to reset).
- **MCP settings** — manage the active project's `.mcp.json` (command/args/env).
- **Hardening (audit batch 2):** filesystem access confined to open project roots,
  editor refuses binary files, terminal fit() zero-dimension guard.
- Tests up to 34 (added fs-confinement + MCP round-trip).

## 0.1.1 — 2026-06-27 (hardened)

Security & robustness pass from a multi-agent audit (17 confirmed findings):

- **Security:** sanitize markdown preview (renderer XSS); SSRF guard on remote HTTP
  relay; remote DB access is read-only; WebSocket payload cap; remote server binds
  to the Tailscale interface when present instead of all-interfaces.
- **Robustness:** flush pending writes on quit (no more lost drafts/settings);
  atomic config writes (no corruption on crash); PTY replay no longer breaks
  mid-escape; canvas positions cleaned up; sqlite probe handle closed.
- **Tests:** first Vitest suite (26 tests) — layout engine, cURL parser, theme
  math, SSH builder, security guards.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-27 (first installable build)

First packaged release. Terminal-first dev cockpit:

- Multi-agent terminals (Claude/Codex/Gemini/custom) with Tabs / Grid / Canvas
  layouts, splits, persistence, session registry, resume, send-to-agent.
- Monaco editor (+ markdown Edit/Split/Preview), API client (+ cURL import),
  database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite), embedded browser with comment-to-AI.
- Prompt composer (@file + /snippet), project groups + Ctrl+K switcher, three
  wabi-sabi themes, status bar with git identity, Git accounts, SSH hosts.
- Mobile remote (terminals + DB + HTTP + file attach) over a token-guarded server.
- Installable via electron-builder (NSIS + portable).
