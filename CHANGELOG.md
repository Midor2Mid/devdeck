# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-06-27 (hardened)

Security & robustness pass from a multi-agent audit (17 confirmed findings):

- **Security:** sanitize markdown preview (renderer XSS); SSRF guard on remote HTTP
  relay; remote DB access is read-only; WebSocket payload cap; remote server binds
  to the Tailscale interface when present instead of all-interfaces.
- **Robustness:** flush pending writes on quit (no more lost drafts/settings);
  atomic config writes (no corruption on crash); PTY replay no longer breaks
  mid-escape; canvas positions cleaned up; sqlite probe handle closed.
- **Tests:** first Vitest suite (26 tests) — layout engine, cURL parser, theme
  math, SSH builder, security guards.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-27 (first installable build)

First packaged release. Terminal-first dev cockpit:

- Multi-agent terminals (Claude/Codex/Gemini/custom) with Tabs / Grid / Canvas
  layouts, splits, persistence, session registry, resume, send-to-agent.
- Monaco editor (+ markdown Edit/Split/Preview), API client (+ cURL import),
  database (PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQLite), embedded browser with comment-to-AI.
- Prompt composer (@file + /snippet), project groups + Ctrl+K switcher, three
  wabi-sabi themes, status bar with git identity, Git accounts, SSH hosts.
- Mobile remote (terminals + DB + HTTP + file attach) over a token-guarded server.
- Installable via electron-builder (NSIS + portable).
