# Roadmap — DevDeck

The vision is all-in-one. The build is sequenced into milestones so there's a usable daily-driver early, with every later panel plugging into the same workspace shell. Keep each milestone ruthlessly shippable.

**Design north star:** ease of use + Japanese **wabi-sabi** — simplicity, calm, restraint, natural/imperfect beauty, quiet space. One earthy accent, minimal chrome, an ensō brand mark. Every feature must earn its visual weight; default to removing. (See `NOTES.md` → "Design north star".)

> Direction confirmed 2026-06-27: pursue **all four** next-step tracks over time (terminal polish, Monaco editor, API depth, deeper Claude). Default shell stays PowerShell.

## Milestone 1 — Terminal + project core (the beating heart) ✅ MVP

- [x] App shell: Electron + electron-vite + React + TS, runs on Windows
- [x] Resizable layout (sidebar | main | terminal area) via `allotment`
- [x] Project sidebar: add a project (folder picker), list projects, select active project; persisted to disk
- [x] Multi-terminal: tabbed terminals via xterm.js + `@lydell/node-pty`, each spawned with `cwd` = active project
- [x] "New terminal" and "New Claude session" buttons (Claude session = pty launching `claude` in the project)
- [x] Terminals survive project switches (per-project terminal groups)

### Milestone 1.5 — terminal core polish ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] Split panes within a tab (binary layout tree; split right/down, close + collapse)
- [x] Pty buffer-replay: panes detach/re-attach without killing sessions (kill is explicit)
- [x] Persist + restore tabs/splits per project across restarts (`workspace.json`)
- [x] Rename tabs (double-click)
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts (new/close/split/cycle/find — all `Ctrl+Shift+…`, captured before xterm)
- [x] In-terminal search (`@xterm/addon-search`)

**Definition of done for the MVP:** I can add my real projects, switch between them with one click (no manual `cd`), and run several terminals — including parallel Claude CLI sessions — side by side, labeled. It's good enough to replace Windows Terminal for a day.

## Milestone 2 — Editor panel ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] File tree for the active project
- [x] Monaco editor: open, edit, save files (syntax highlighting, per-file undo)
- [x] Tabs for open files; dirty indicators
- [x] Monaco workers bundled locally (offline; no CDN) + wabi-sabi editor theme

## Milestone 3 — API client panel (Postman-lite) ✅ (2026-06-28)

- [x] Request builder: method, URL, headers, query params, body (JSON/form)
- [x] Send via main process (native `fetch`, bypasses CORS); status, timing, headers, pretty body (Monaco viewer)
- [x] Per-project request history + saved requests (collections), persisted to `settings.json`
- [x] **Beyond scope:** auth config, environments/variables, collections search + move/duplicate, **Import** (Postman / OpenAPI-Swagger / cURL → collections), cURL smart-paste into the URL bar

## Milestone 3.5 — Database panel ✅ (2026-06-27, partial)

- [x] Per-project saved connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL) with encrypted passwords (`safeStorage`)
- [x] Connect / test, list tables, run SQL (Monaco editor, Ctrl+Enter), results grid
- [x] **SQLite via WASM** (`node-sqlite3-wasm`, 2026-06-27) — no native build; reads/writes real `.db` files, file picker in the connection form
- [ ] Query history / saved queries per connection
- [x] Packaging: `node-sqlite3-wasm` unpacked from asar in `electron-builder` config (`package.json` → `asarUnpack`) — done in M11

## Milestone 7 — Remote / mobile access ✅ (2026-06-27, terminals-first)

- [x] Multi-client pty (event bus + per-client buffer replay) so a phone can attach to live sessions
- [x] Token-guarded HTTP + WebSocket server in the main process (off by default)
- [x] Self-contained mobile web client (xterm served from node_modules): session list, attach, live output, input + quick keys, start a Claude session remotely
- [x] Settings → Remote: enable, port, token (regen), Tailscale/LAN URL + QR
- [x] Verified end-to-end headlessly (auth 401/reject, session broadcast, shell output over WS)
- Reach from anywhere: **Tailscale** (private, recommended) — bind is 0.0.0.0 but token-gated
- [ ] Later: TLS option, full-UI mobile client, push notification on attention

## Milestone 4 — Network debugging ✅ (2026-06-28)

- [x] Local HTTP proxy to capture requests/responses (`src/main/proxy.ts`) — loopback-only forward proxy, off by default; full HTTP capture with gzip/deflate/br body decode; HTTPS via CONNECT tunneled end-to-end (encrypted, metadata only — no MITM)
- [x] Request list + inspector (`NetworkPanel.tsx`) — live list (method/status/host/path/time/size); inspector tabs for request/response headers + bodies (JSON pretty-printed)
- [x] Filter by project / host — free-text host/path/method/status filter + "this project" toggle (captures tagged with the active project at capture time)
- [x] Start/stop toggle, persisted port (`settings.network.port`, default 8899), copy proxy address, clear; covered by `tests/proxy.test.ts`
- [ ] Later: HTTPS MITM (generated CA) to decrypt tunneled payloads; replay/edit-and-resend a captured request into the API client

> Distinct from M19's **browser** network capture (`src/main/browserNet.ts`, CDP on the embedded webview, feeds the "→ Agent" payload). M4 is the general-purpose proxy for arbitrary client traffic: set `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY` to the proxy address and watch it in the Network panel.

## Milestone 5 — Deeper Claude CLI integration ✅ (2026-06-27, core)

- [x] Session registry: all Claude sessions across projects in the sidebar, status + click-to-jump
- [x] Status without parsing output — activity (working/idle) + terminal bell (attention); visibility-aware
- [x] Tab-level status dots; attention badge
- [x] Quick-resume (`claude --continue`)
- [x] Cross-pane action: send a file's `@path` from the editor into the last-focused Claude session
- [ ] Later: send API response / DB result into a session; rename sessions independently of tabs

## Milestone 6 — Settings hub ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] Left-nav modal (reference-style): Appearance, Terminal, Editor, Claude, Shortcuts, About
- [x] Persisted to `settings.json`; wired to real behavior:
  - Appearance: accent color (single wabi-sabi accent, applied to CSS vars)
  - Terminal: default shell (PowerShell / cmd / Git Bash / WSL / custom) + font family/size (live)
  - Editor: font size, tab size, word wrap, minimap
  - Claude: command, resume args, idle→attention timing
- [ ] Later sections: **AI settings** (the rest shipped: Git multi-account → M15, SSH → M16, Remote → M7, MCP → M18, light theme → M10)

## Milestone 8 — 1DevTool-inspired depth ✅ (2026-06-27)

From studying the 1DevTool reference (video + 1devtool.com):
- [x] **Multi-agent sessions** — agent presets (Claude/Codex/Gemini/custom) with type badges; generalized from Claude-only
- [x] **Prompt composer** — rich prompt box with `@file` mentions → focused agent (Ctrl+Shift+P)
- [x] **Project groups** — collapsible named groups in the sidebar
- [x] **Project switcher** — Ctrl+K launchpad grid (search, live counts, keyboard nav)
- [x] **Markdown preview** — Edit/Split/Preview + word count
- [x] **Status bar** — git branch + change count, attention, remote, project
- [ ] Later (from reference): **image-preview tabs, more DB engines** (the rest shipped: agent pipelines → `pipeline.ts`, embedded browser → M9, AI diff → ticket→PR loop, activity feed → M20)

## Milestone 9 — more 1DevTool-inspired features ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **SQLite** via `node-sqlite3-wasm` (no native build)
- [x] **Paste cURL → parse** into an API request
- [x] **Composer drafts** persisted per project + a discoverable launcher bar
- [x] **In-app notifications** (toasts) when a background agent needs attention
- [x] **Mobile DB + HTTP** — run SQL / send HTTP requests from the phone client
- [x] **Embedded browser** panel + **Comment Mode** → click page elements, annotate, send grouped feedback to the focused agent
- [ ] Later: **AI quota display** (the rest shipped: browser screenshot/console/network capture → M14/M19, terminal Canvas → M13, Dashboard → M12)

## Milestone 10 — themes, polish & perf ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Theme system** — Sumi (dark, default), Washi (light), Zen (airy dark); picker in Settings → Appearance; applied across UI (CSS vars), terminal (xterm) and editor (Monaco). User chose mockups from generated PNGs first.
- [x] Accent customization derives `--accent-soft` as a proper tint (lighter on dark, darker on light)
- [x] **Perf:** debounced disk persistence (was writing on every composer keystroke / accent drag)
- [x] Theme-aware scrollbars
- [x] Spacing/typography theming (Zen's airiness), per-theme density — `themes.ts` COMPACT/AIRY density vars + per-theme line height

## Milestone 11 — installable app + robustness ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Packaging** via electron-builder (NSIS + portable); asar-unpack for node-pty / sqlite-wasm / xterm; ensō app icon; verified the packaged `DevDeck.exe` launches standalone
- [x] **Error boundary** (no more white-screen on a render error)
- [x] Window bounds + last-view restored across restarts
- [ ] Later: code signing; auto-update

## Milestone 12 — snippets + dashboard layout ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Prompt snippets** — `/name` autocomplete in the composer (user-defined in Settings → Snippets)
- [x] **Dashboard grid layout** — toggle the terminal area between Tabs and a grid of all the project's terminals at once (persisted)

## Milestone 13 — Canvas layout ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Canvas** terminal layout — free-form board: drag terminal cards anywhere, pan the surface; positions persisted. Third layout alongside Tabs + Grid.

## Milestone 14 — mobile attach + browser capture ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Mobile attach** — pick a screenshot/file on the phone → saved into the project (`.devdeck/uploads/`) → path typed into the agent session
- [x] **Browser capture** — "Send to AI" now includes recent console errors/warnings + a page screenshot (saved + path referenced) alongside the element comments

## Milestone 15 — Git multi-account ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Git accounts** in Settings → Git (label, user.name, user.email, custom SSH command)
- [x] Apply an account to the active project from the **status bar** (writes the repo's local `git config` incl. `core.sshCommand`); status bar shows the current identity
- [ ] Later: store PATs (encrypted) for HTTPS push; token verification

## Milestone 16 — SSH hosts ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **SSH profiles** in Settings → SSH (label, user, host, port, extra args); launch a connected terminal from the ▾ menu

## Milestone 17 — command palette + canvas zoom ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **Command palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P): fuzzy access to views, layouts, themes, new agent/SSH sessions, jump-to-session, settings, project switch. Composer hotkey moved to Ctrl+Shift+I.
- [x] **Canvas zoom** (Ctrl+scroll, 40–200%) + double-click to reset view

## Milestone 18 — MCP settings + audit batch 2 ✅ (2026-06-27)

- [x] **MCP** settings section — edit the active project's `.mcp.json` (servers: command/args/env) read by Claude Code & other agents
- [x] Audit batch 2: fs path confinement to project roots, binary-file guard, terminal fit() zero-dim guard

This completes every section from the original 1DevTool reference (Appearance, Terminal, Editor, Agents, Snippets, Git, SSH, MCP, Remote, Shortcuts, About).

## Milestone 19 — network capture + API smart-paste ✅ (2026-06-28)

- [x] **Browser network capture** (CDP on the webview): comment-to-AI now includes a request summary + failed/4xx/5xx requests
- [x] **API smart-paste** — paste a cURL command into the URL bar and it auto-parses (Postman-style); replaces the separate cURL button

## Milestone 20 — activity feed + canvas connectors ✅ (2026-06-28)

- [x] **Activity feed** — ⧗ in the sidebar opens a drawer of agent events (started / needs-attention / closed) across all projects; click to jump
- [x] **Canvas connectors** — ⚯ handle to link cards; SVG lines follow pan/zoom; click a line to remove; persisted

The reference feature set is fully covered. Remaining ideas are open-ended (terminal record/replay, embedded-browser polish).

## Milestone 21 — design pass + Lacquer style ✅ (2026-06-29)

From a live-app design review against the wabi-sabi north star:
- [x] **Ensō brand mark** — a real single-stroke ensō (`Enso.tsx`) for the rail logo + sidebar wordmark, replacing the placeholder "D" and the spinner-like ring
- [x] **Empty-state ensō watermark** — a faint accent ensō behind empty panels so they read as intentional space; muted/faint text contrast lifted to WCAG AA across themes; Settings modal backdrop now dims + blurs
- [x] **Terminal toolbar declutter** — grouped into create / layout / pane clusters; secondary tools (record, recordings, worktrees, review changes) moved into a `⋯` overflow; 13 → 10 controls
- [x] **Lacquer style** — a new opt-in design style (Settings → Appearance → Style): frosted-glass surfaces, gilded gradient accent buttons, soft accent glow on active tabs / rail / ensō, deep layered shadows, plus an animated sheen sweep + breathing ensō glow (honors `prefers-reduced-motion`). Additive — existing styles and the default are unchanged.
- [x] **Local signed builds** — `npm run cert:make` + `npm run package:signed` produce a self-signed Authenticode build (personal-use) to avoid unsigned-binary AV false positives; shipped as the signed **v0.4.2** release.

## Later / maybe (parking lot)

> Pruned 2026-06-28: command palette (M17), split terminals + layout restore (M1.5), Git multi-account (M15), SSH profiles (M16), remote/mobile (M7), MCP (M18), embedded browser (M9), light theme (M10), snippets (M12), and file-`@path`-into-session (M5) all shipped. What's left is genuinely unbuilt:

- **AI settings** section (model/quota/keys) — only remaining Settings section
- Cross-platform (macOS/Linux) polish
- Per-terminal / per-project shell override (default shell is configurable; per-terminal is not)
- Saved command runner per project (snippets shipped; a runnable command list did not)
- Remote project folders over SSH (SSH terminals shipped; mounting remote folders did not)
- Pipe an **API response / DB result** straight into a running Claude session (file `@path` shipped; response piping did not)
- Encrypted **PAT** storage for Git HTTPS push (identities shipped in M15; token storage did not)
- TLS + push-notification-on-attention for the remote server
- Terminal record/replay; agent pipeline UI on top of `pipeline.ts`

## Decisions log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| 2026-06-26 | Electron + electron-vite + React + TS | Best-in-class terminal libs (xterm.js, pty), easy to add Monaco + HTTP client; ship fast on Windows. |
| 2026-06-26 | `@lydell/node-pty` instead of `node-pty` | Ships prebuilt binaries → no MSVC C++ toolchain needed (user's machine lacks the compiler). Removes the #1 Windows setup risk. |
| 2026-06-26 | Sequence "all-in-one" into milestones; terminal/project core first | User chose the all-in-one vision; honored in architecture, but the terminal core must be excellent before layering editor/API/network or it's all lipstick. |
| 2026-06-26 | `allotment` for layout | Lightweight resizable split panes; defer a full docking lib (dockview/rc-dock) until layout needs grow. |
| 2026-06-27 | Pinned Electron 33 + Vite 5 (not latest 42 / 7) | Electron 42's installer (`@electron/get@5`) is ESM-only and needs Node ≥22.12; machine runs 22.11. Electron 33 + Vite 5 support Node 22.11 cleanly. Revisit after a Node LTS bump. |
| 2026-06-27 | Verified `@lydell/node-pty` loads under Electron's ABI | Headless Electron smoke test spawned a shell with no rebuild/compiler — confirms the prebuilt-binary bet before building UI on it. |
| 2026-06-27 | Pty sessions own a replay buffer; panes don't kill on unmount | Lets a pane detach/re-attach (splits, tab/project switches) without losing the session — main keeps the pty + ~256 KB tail, replayed to the new xterm. Kill is explicit only. |
| 2026-06-27 | Split layout = binary tree, terminal-mgmt keys are `Ctrl+Shift+…` | Tree keeps split/close/collapse simple and serializable for persistence. `Ctrl+Shift` combos (captured before xterm) avoid clobbering shell keys like Ctrl+C/Ctrl+W. |
| 2026-06-27 | DB panel ships Postgres + MySQL first; SQLite deferred | `pg`/`mysql2` are pure-JS (no compiler); `better-sqlite3` is native and won't build without MSVC. SQLite will use a WASM driver later to stay compiler-free. |
| 2026-06-27 | DB passwords encrypted at rest via Electron `safeStorage` (DPAPI) | Avoid plaintext credentials on disk; passwords are never sent back to the renderer (only referenced by connection id). |
| 2026-06-27 | Claude status from activity + bell, not output parsing | Coupling to Claude CLI's text output is fragile (NOTES risk). Output-activity (working/idle) and the bell char `\x07` (attention) are format-independent and intentional signals. Visibility-aware so viewing a session clears attention and buffer-replay doesn't false-trigger. |
| 2026-06-27 | Mobile access = terminals-first + Tailscale; pty made multi-client | A remote terminal is RCE surface, so: off by default, token required, prefer Tailscale (no public exposure). Pty refactored to an event bus + per-client buffer replay so phone + desktop attach to the same sessions. Session metadata stays in the renderer and is synced to the server. |
